Squash The Creep High SpeedGame Description:

Game Description: I have developed a 3D version of the game called "Squash The Creep" using Godot v4.3. While the original concept was based on the popular 2D game "Dodge the Creep," I decided to take it a step further by translating the gameplay into a 3D environment, which adds depth and complexity to the experience.

In this game, instead of merely dodging enemies like in "Dodge the Creep," the player must actively squash the "creeps" â€” enemy creatures that move around the environment. The game is designed to be challenging but still highly engaging, as players need to navigate through a 3D space while dealing with an increasing number of creeps.
