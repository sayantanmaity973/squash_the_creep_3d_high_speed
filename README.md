Squash The Creep High SpeedGame Description:

The Game "Squash The Creep" using Godot v4.3 is inspired by the classic 2D game "Dodge the Creep," but with a significant twist—while the original focused on avoiding enemies, my version elevates the experience into a fully immersive 3D environment. This transformation not only adds visual depth but also introduces new layers of strategy and challenge to the gameplay. In "Squash The Creep," the goal is no longer just survival; players must actively squash the creeps, enemy creatures that roam the environment. These creeps move unpredictably, creating a fast-paced challenge where players must think quickly and react even faster. The 3D space brings complexity to movement, as players must navigate in all directions, using the environment to their advantage as they hunt down the creeps.

To increase the excitement and give players an edge, I’ve introduced a speed boost mechanic. This feature allows the player's character to temporarily move faster than the enemies, adding a layer of strategy to the gameplay. With the speed boost, players can quickly close the gap on creeps, dodge attacks, or escape dangerous situations. Timing the use of the boost becomes essential, as players must decide when to use it to either gain the upper hand or escape a swarm of creeps.With the speed boost, players can quickly close the gap on creeps, dodge attacks, or escape dangerous situations.
